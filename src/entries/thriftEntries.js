    location: `Pittsburgh, PA`,
    description: `This is one of my favorite thrfit finds; I love how the collar color (ha!) contrasts with the black! It's also perfect for the cold because the double collar keeps my neck really warm and snuggly :-) I got this piece at a random second-hand clothes fundraising event I came across on campus after class one day, super glad I stopped by!

    P.S. pants are also thrifted (from Goodwill), they're SUCH GOOD KHAKIS! Obsessed with this outfit.

    location: 'Pittsburgh, PA',
    description: `I got this from Avalon at their semi-annual dollar sale, but as you can see, NOT for a dollar! I took my friend thrifting and promised that I wouldn't get anything for myself, but... I had been on the lookout for a jumpsuit AND my favorite color is maroon! The jumpsuit was hanging on top of a rack on the way to the "dollar section", so it really felt like ~destiny~... I know, I know, that's how they get you.. but I'm still very happy with this purchase!

    place: `"borrowed" from my mom's closet`,
    description: `One summer, I visited New York for two weeks and had only brought a thin rain jacket which my mom lent to me before the trip. One afternoon, we decided to take the ferry to New Jersey. Oh boy, was this a bad idea. We had gone to Carlo's Bake Shop and when we came out of the bakery, it was pouring. The box of pastries got soaked and even started to fall apart. .... and this was when I found out that the jacket wasn't actually a rain jacket.
